look into localstorage and sessionstorage - for retrieval of articles using since
Add to archive and delete features

State of the project
--------------------
The project I want is a bit complicated and would take a lot
of time. Instead, a minimalistic version can be made. Where,
you just ask for the user input on the number of articles to be read
Give the random options. Set a default method for the articles
that is, delete or archive after use or none. There should be
a delete and archive icon similar to Pocket
Need to mention the provider of content below. Link image to
Pocket's reader and the tet to actual link to the website
Add a open all in new tab feature
Make separate section for unread, archived and favorites
Allow the methods to be used on each individual of them

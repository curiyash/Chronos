1) Losing weight as a global variable and making it a local variable
This caused the code to break for boundedKnapsack. I don't get what the problem is.
Let's reset the weight to global and try again
-> It works
What could be the issue?
The Problem was addition of weight to a number. Weight is a string and not a number

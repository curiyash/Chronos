1) We need the JSON file from Pocket
Everytime? Possibly, how will I know the items that have been deleted? -> I'll have to sync with Pocket
So, certainly I cannot bog servers for this, right?
I'll have to bog the client-side JS
Server will be used for doing CRUD on MongoDB maybe
Alright, so I wouldn't need the JSON file again and again. It's a one time deal
Using it internally seems the way to go
I could possibly use Firebase, but there's only a use of it if I use it

2) For sorting, we could just do a quick Pocket API call. They have done as far as we need

3) Get on the idea of reminding users of articles instead of users reminding themselves
Include a surprise me option

4) status: 2 in article JSON indicates that it is deleted
status 0: means added/modified
